			<h2>
				<br>Hello!</br> My name is Sophia and I am pursuing a second bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 
				<br>I just finished my first semester at CUNY Hunter College so I still have a long road ahead.</br>
				During my first semester, I took an Intro to Computer Science course, where we learned Python. 
				<br>I continued to learn Python during my winter break, but I also really wanted to start a project that I could continue to work on and learn from throughout the semester.</br>
				Thus, I decided to learn HTML and CSS and create my own website. 
				<br> So far, it's been so fun to see how my website has grown from the day I started it </br> 
				It's still very far from polished, but I have been working on it every day.
