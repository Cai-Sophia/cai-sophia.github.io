# Hi there! My name is Sophia Cai and I am a current Computer Science student at Hunter college. I am self-learning HTML and CSS through creating my own personal website. 
# I am still learning all there is to know about creating websites, so any feedback is appreciated.
# You can contact me at cai_sophia@outlook.com
# I hope you enjoy watching my website grow with me!
